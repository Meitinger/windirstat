WinDirStat (with file owner filtering)
======================================


Description
-----------
This is bseifert's great [WinDirStat](http://windirstat.info/) utility which
allows you to display the content of a directory in a very intuitive way as far
as the size of each file and subfolder is concerned. With one addition: you can
also specify which user(s) you are actually interested in. This is especially
useful for sysadmins and users who exceed their quota on a network share, since
they are not interested in all the files but only some/their own files.


Usage
-----
It's the same as the original WinDirStat, so please refer to the original
documentation. The user selection dialog (Active Directory object picker) is
displayed immediately after the directory dialog. If you don't want to filter
files for any user(s) then simply cancel the second dialog. Otherwise insert
the user names and press OK.
